With myStore, which is fully responsive, we've packed in a big bunch of settings letting you customize almost everything from the header colors and layouts to the body content design to selecting between 5 different footer layouts in premium. We've integrated with WooCommerce so you can easily build an online store and select between 2 different WooCommerce layouts, integrated with SiteOrigin's Page Builder plugin allowing you to easily build beautiful page layouts that you want, added styling for Contact Form 7 for your online forms and more. myStore also comes with a simple beautiful default slider as well as the options to add other sliders.
